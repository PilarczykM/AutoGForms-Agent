# AutoGF-Agent

AutoGF-Agent is a CLI-based application that uses an AI agent with a customizable personality to automatically fill out **public Google Forms**. Built with **CrewAI** and **Playwright**, it simulates natural, personality-driven responses and includes an optional supervisor agent to evaluate answer quality.

## üöÄ Features

- Fills out **public** Google Forms (no login required).
- Supports multiple question types: text fields, multiple choice, scales.
- Personality-aware responses based on user-defined traits.
- Optional response evaluation and correction via a Supervisor Agent.
- Simple CLI interface.

## üß† How It Works

1. **User** runs the CLI with:
   - Language (`--lang`)
   - Personality traits (`--personality`)
   - Google Form URL (`--form-url`)
   - Optional quality check (`--enforce-quality-check`)

2. **FormAgent** (CrewAI) generates responses according to personality and language.

3. **Playwright** opens the Google Form and fills in the answers.

4. **SupervisorAgent** evaluates the responses (optional):
   - Checks stylistic coherence and quality.
   - Provides a rating and comments.
   - Optionally regenerates or fixes answers.

5. **Output** includes:
   - Completed Google Form
   - CLI feedback
   - Quality report (if enabled)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations (MVP)

- Does not support file uploads or custom components.
- Personality affects tone and style, not factual correctness.
- SupervisorAgent cannot directly edit forms‚Äîonly suggests or triggers re-generation.
